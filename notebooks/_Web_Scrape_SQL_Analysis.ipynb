    "# Insights:\n",
    "# - The Lakers lead all teams in jersey appearances, driven by both elite social media presence and consistent winning.\n",
    "# - The Grizzlies and Hornets appear frequently despite lower performance and follower ranks — indicating player-driven sales (e.g., Ja Morant, LaMelo Ball).\n",
    "# - Some successful teams like the Spurs have fewer jersey appearances — suggesting performance doesn't always drive merchandise sales.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Recommendation:\n",
    "# - Double down on marketing for teams with both strong player brands and high online engagement.\n",
    "# - Consider collaborations with individual players even if their team’s performance is average.\n",
    "# - Investigate underperforming teams with large fanbases (e.g., Knicks) for branding opportunities.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Prediction:\n",
    "# - Continued jersey sales growth will align more with player influence and social engagement than historical wins.\n",
    "# - Optimizing campaigns based on social rank + jersey trends can increase ROI for merch-focused initiatives.\n",
